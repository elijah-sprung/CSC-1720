# CSC-1720
All of my code from my CSC-1720 programming class.

This is a repository with all code written during my time in the course CSC-1720, which is the Advanced Programming with Data Structures course for Computer Science at High Point University.

Labs were used to introduce a new concept in a group setting while Programs were individual assignments meant to test multiple skills at once without any assistance.
